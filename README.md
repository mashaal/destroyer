## Getting Started:

![start](http://destroyer.audio/static/start.gif)

* Download and open **Destroyer**.
* Drop your music collection onto **Destroyer**.
* **Destroyer** will recursively scan your collection and build library based on metadata.

**Note:** **Destroyer** is dependant on metadata â€” it can process [Vorbis](https://wiki.xiph.org/Metadata) comments as well as [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3) (1.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) tags. Please ensure your collection is properly formatted.

## On Metadata:

![metadata](http://destroyer.audio/static/metadata.gif)

> `Menu > Destroyer > Edit Metadata...` or `cmd-m`

* On import, **Destroyer** will analyze your collection for incomplete/missing metadata.
* You can view/edit metadata in the metadata view `cmd-m`

**Protip:** While playing a track, toggling the metadata view will take you directly to the currently playing album.

## On Artwork:

![artwork](http://destroyer.audio/static/artwork.gif)

* **Destroyer** works best when all the tracks for an album are in one flat directory.
* **Destroyer** will look for a file named `cover.jpg` in the album's directory.
* You can drag and drop new artwork in the metadata view.

## On Search:

![search](http://destroyer.audio/static/search.gif)

* Type anywhere in the library view to filter your collection.
* `esc` will clear your filter.
